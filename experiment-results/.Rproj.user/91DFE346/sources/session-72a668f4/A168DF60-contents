# Part 1 Below 

#(Run a repeated measures ANOVA using the ezANOVA() function in the “ez” library in
# R to determine whether there is a main effect of stress on performance, a main effect of
# motivation on performance, and an interaction between stress and motivation on
# performance.)

ez_results <- ezANOVA(

  type = 3

# (Make a table that shows the four means for each combination of conditions)

# Group by stress and motivation, then calculate the mean RT for each combination
means_table <- data %>%
  group_by(stress, motivation) %>%
  summarize(mean_RT = mean(RT))

# Print the result
print(means_table)


# Part 3 Below 
# (Given your results in 1) and 2), give an interpretation of the main effects and
#interactions found in the experiment, interpreting all and only the significant results
#(using a p<.05 criterion for significance).)

# Based on the results from Parts 1 and 2, we can see that if the participants were stressed, they were significantly impacted in their response times. 
# However, the same cannot be seen if the participants were motivated, as the p-value does not go below 0.05.
# Lastly, if the participants were stressed *and* motivated, then their response times were significantly impacted but in the opposite direction, and the 
# same also goes for when they were unstressed and unmotivated.


# Part 4 Below
# (Show the ANOVA that she should run in ezANOVA and the show the
# resulting ANOVA table.)

# Run the mixed-design ANOVA
anova_results <- ezANOVA(
  data = data,
  dv = RT,                              # dependent variable: response time

  between = .(gender, occupation),      # between-subject factors
  type = 3
)

# Display the ANOVA table
print(anova_results)

#There are significant impacts on RT based on occupation, stress, and motivation (all by themselves).


# Part 5 Below
# (Make a bar graph or line chart that visually shows all of the new, between-subjects
# significant effects you described in Question 4.)

means_table <- data %>%
  group_by(stress, motivation, gender, occupation) %>%
  summarize(mean_RT = mean(RT, na.rm = TRUE))

# Part 6 Below
# (Conduct an ANOVA using the lm() function in R for running this univariate ANOVA
# (you can’t use ezANOVA any more because ezANOVA assumes you have a column that
# identifies the subjects’ IDs for the purposes of matching up data, and in this experiment
# there is only one subject).)

# Fit a linear model using stress and motivation as factors
model <- lm(RT ~ stress * motivation, data = data)

# Display the ANOVA table
anova_results <- anova(model)
print(anova_results)


# Part 7 Below
# (Given that we used the same data for the ANOVAs in Questions 1 and 6, why did you
# get different results in terms of which effects were significant (at a p<.05 level)?)

# We get different results between Questions 1 and 6 duer to the fact that the repeated measures that ANOVA (Question 1) controls for subject variability, which
# makes it more sensitive to significant effects.
# The univariate ANOVA (Question 6) treats every data point as independent, which leads to potentially different conclusions about significance.
